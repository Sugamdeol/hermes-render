# Entrypoint wrapper for the render-tools image.
#
# Runs as root (PID-1 child of tini). On every boot it:
#   1. Ensures /opt/data exists and is owned by hermes:hermes.
#   2. Restores optional state from GoFile.
#   3. Seeds the upstream config template when this is a fresh instance.
#   4. Runs the config patcher as the hermes user. On a fresh template it
#      lowers known upstream resource defaults; later boots preserve edits.
#      Integration entries remain idempotent and insert-only.
#   5. Starts the optional state-sync worker and exec's the upstream
#      entrypoint chain with the original args (default CMD is `gateway run`).
#
# The upstream entrypoint also chowns /opt/data and drops to the hermes
# user via gosu for the gateway process. Our chown here is redundant in
# the happy path but harmless, and it lets the patcher run on a fresh
# disk that hasn't been chowned yet.
